Here are the key files and folders:

### **`src`**

The `src` folder is the key folder in the repo. This is where you will spend most of your time managing your site.

- `templates` - This folder contains page template. Each template references a stream in Yext and turns into a collection of pages based on the entities in the stream. [Learn more about templates](Templates%2017ff9e34f8064fa8bcee1442cfc02e5f.md)
- `pages` - This folder contains static pages. Each file in this folder represents a single page at a single URL.
- `components` - There is nothing special about this folder however it is common convention to store any shared components across pages and templates in this folder.

### **`sites-config`**

Inside the `sites-config` folder is the `ci_config.json` file. This file tells Sites how to build your site. You will not have to edit this file unless you want to customize the build process. You can learn more here.

### **Other Files**

There are some other configuration files that you might want to edit for more advanced use cases.

- `entry.server.js` - This is the entry point on the server for every page. This script runs `reactDom.renderToString`. Learn more here.
- `entry.client.js` - This is the entry point on the client for every page. This script handles hydration. Learn more here.
